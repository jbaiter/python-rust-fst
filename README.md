Python bindings for [burntsushi's][1] [fst crate][2] ([rustdocs][3])
for FST-backed sets and maps.

For reasons why you might want to consider using it, see BurntSushi's great
article on ["Index[ing] 1,600,000,000 Keys with Automata and Rust"][4].

**tl;dr**:
- Work with larger-than-memory sets
- Perform fuzzy search using Levenshtein automata


## Installation
`rust_fst` is available as a binary wheel for the most common platforms (Linux
64bit x86, Windows 32/64bit x86 and OSX 64bit x86) and thus **does not require
a Rust installation.**

Just run `pip install rust_fst` to install the latest stable version of the
package.


## Development
- You will need:
    * Python >= 3.3, Python or PyPy >= 2.7 with development headers installed
    * Rust nightly (install via [rustup][5])
- Run `rustup override add nightly` to add an override for rustup to use the
  nightly channel for the repository
- Install with pip (without the `-e` flag, it does not work!)
- Run tests with `py.test python-rust-fst/tests` and make sure you are not
  in the root of the repo, since the installed (and compiled) package will not
  be used in that case.


## Status
The package exposes almost all functionality of the `fst` crate, except for:

- Using raw transducers


## Examples
```python
from rust_fst import Map, Set

# Building a set in memory
keys = ["fa", "fo", "fob", "focus", "foo", "food", "foul"]
s = Set.from_iter(keys)

# Fuzzy searches on the set
matches = list(s.search(term="foo", max_dist=1))
assert matches == ["fo", "fob", "foo", "food"]

# Searching with a regular expression
matches = list(s.search_re(r'f\w{2}'))
assert matches == ["fob", "foo"]

# Store map on disk, requiring only constant memory for querying
items = [("bruce", 1), ("clarence", 2), ("stevie", 3)]
m = Map.from_iter(items, path="/tmp/map.fst")

# Find all items whose key is greater or equal (in lexicographical sense) to
# 'clarence'
matches = dict(m['clarence':])
assert matches == {'clarence': 2, 'stevie': 3}

# Create a map from a file input, using generators/yield
# The input file must be sorted on the first column, and look roughly like
#   keyA 123
#   keyB 456
def file_iterator(fpath):
  with open(fpath, 'rt') as fp:
    for line in fp:
      key, value = line.strip().split()
      yield key, int(value)
m = Map.from_iter( file_iterator('/your/input/file/'), '/your/mmapped/output.fst')

# re-open a file you built previously with from_iter()
m = Map(path='/path/to/existing.fst')

# slicing multiple sets efficiently
a = Set.from_iter(["bar", "foo"])
b = Set.from_iter(["baz", "foo"])
list(UnionSet(a, b)['ba':'bb'])
['bar', 'baz']

# searching multiple sets efficiently
a = Set.from_iter(["bar", "foo"])
b = Set.from_iter(["baz", "foo"])
list(UnionSet(a, b).search('ba', 1)
['bar', 'baz']

# searching multiple sets with a regex efficiently
a = Set.from_iter(["bar", "foo"])
b = Set.from_iter(["baz", "foo"])
list(UnionSet(a, b).search_re(r'b\w{2}')
['bar', 'baz']
```
